                    CHALLENGES FACED
Question c, e and g were the hardest

Question_a (greet_user ) was simple for me because I have done something similar to it before so I didn’t take to long with it, I used 5 minutes
The second question ( is_positive) was not that hard for me , why ? It wasn’t hard because I have solved this kind of question before so it was a little bit easy for me. So I didn’t use up to 20 minutes while solving it
The third question ( print_odd)the mistake I made is that  I was using the “If statement “which was wrong, and causing a semantic error. 
But as I saw this error I tried to figure what courses the mistake until the thought of “for statements “ come into my mind that was when I later figure the mistake.
Question_ d ( count_ vowel) this code, I haven’t done  it before.  But the first move I did is to search about it on google and I did so but how did I search about it I started with “ write a function that count the number of vowel sound in a sting” and it brought out some codes but I chose the one that is easier for me.
Question_ e ( reverse_strings) this code also I haven’t done it as well and I was asked not to use this reverse sign (::-1) so what I did was, I searched on google what are the reverse sign that we have in python and that was when I saw “reversed and joint, reverse “ but I choose reversed only I wrote the code.
Question_f (is_palindrome  “word”) I searched about it on google to write a function is_ palindrome(word )  it it’s takes me a while before I could get it and understand it.
Question_g ( apply_ discount price, discount _ present ) I also search about it on google too.
Question_h( sum_digits ) I did the same with it I searched it on google.
Same goes to go last question too question_ I.
The question that takes more time while I was doing it is the third question it take me a long time before it come to my mind to use another function which is “for loop”
