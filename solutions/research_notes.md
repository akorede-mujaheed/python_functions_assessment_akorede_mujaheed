## which question where the headest 

question_c
question_e
question_g
question_i


## how did i solved them 


question_c ( print_odd)the first mistake I made whose  that,  I was using the “If statement “ while i was doing it, but it was wrong, and causing a semantic error. 
so as i was trying to figure what the problem is it just came to mind mind that it is "for statement" that i suposse to use. so as soon that come to mind i tried it and it work perfectly.


Question_e ( reverse_strings) this type of question  I haven’t done it before   and I was asked not to use this reverse sign (::-1), so what I did was, I searched on google what are the reverse sign that we have in python that was when I saw "reversed and joint, reverse" but I choose reversed only I wrote the code with reverse function only.



Question_g ( apply_ discount price, discount _ present ) this question i have not done it as well before i dont even know how to do it but i make reseach on google on how to solved the question.


question_i (validate_password(password)) same happend to this i have not done this question to but i also make reseach about it and i got to use the one i understand a little.
